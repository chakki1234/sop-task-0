Egg

The reason for my answer is the clarity that we ourselves miss in posing the question. The eggs were way before the chickens(as we know today) have evolved. But they are not chicken eggs though. Scientific studies say chickens have evolved from gene mutation of chicken like organisms from which gradually the eggs as we know today have evolved. So, to answer this question, evolution is an analog curve and so as to pose a question we have to define the exact features of an egg and chicken and then compare the timeline.
