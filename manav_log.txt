Commands that I used are:
git clone <link> : Clone repo located at <link> onto local machine
git add <file> : Add <file> to the staging area
git commit -m "<message>" : Commit the staged snapshot and use <message> as the commit message
git status : See the status of files
git log : display the entire commit history
git branch: list all the branches in the repo
git checkout -b <branch> : Create and check out a new branch named <branch>.
Drop the -b flag to checkout an existing branch.
git merge <branch> : Merge <branch> into the existing branch
